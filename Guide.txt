1. Open url (Example my server name is servername and project name is projectname)
 * if using apache localhost: http://localhost/projectname/generate
 * Using other server. http://servername/projectname/generate
 * Default servername and projectname is already displayed in textfields, but change it if necessary
 * After generating, you can open the project code using code editor like (VS code, SublimeText, etc.)
 * Front_End folder and Back_End folder is separted: Front_End for User interface and Back_End is for Database and API's


2. Create controller
 * Easily create controller (replace your servername and projectname)
 * Front_End: http://servername/projectname/generate/controller/FE/
 * Back_End: http://servername/projectname/generate/controller/BE/
 * Example: http://localhost/MyFirstProject/generate/controller/FE/
 * You can delete the entire generate folder when development is done and ready for production
